## Privacy
This plugin and the Kroki diagram generation service it uses do not collect, store, process, or transmit any personal data.

The plugin only processes diagram code that you explicitly provide to generate diagrams. This diagram code is sent to the public Kroki service (kroki.io) for rendering, and the service returns only the generated diagram. The diagram code you provide is not stored or retained by either the plugin or the Kroki service.

No user identification, authentication, tracking, or personal information is involved in using this plugin or the Kroki service.
